# Car-Price-Prediction
Predicting the price of the car Using some featured values

The Problem Statement:
This Project is Based on the features of the car, we are going to predict the Car Selling_Price which is our Target Variable and also done End to End Implementation and Deployment of Car Price Prediction using python, flask, scikit-Learn, etc. on Heroku cloud platform.

Description:
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com | Dataset Link

This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

It contains 301 rows and 8 columns.

The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

car_name

Ex:ritz,swift,fiesta...etc

year

Manufacturing year of the car. Ex: 2007,2018...etc

selling_price(Dependent Column)

Present price of the car

km_driven

Number of kilometers the car travelled since manufacture date

fuel

i.e..Petrol,Diesel& CNG

seller_type

i.e..Dealer, Individual

transmission

i.e..Manual, Automatic

Owner

owner name already converted to 0,1,3
